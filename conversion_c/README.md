This folder will contain several programs meant for unit conversions written in the c-language. This is intended for me to practice writing simple programs in C in hopes of establishing a strong understanding of C basics.

a. Temperature conversion (convert_temperature.c)
    This program is designed to convert temperature between the following units: C-Celsius, F-Fahrenheit, K-Kelvin. To use, the program will ask you to input your query in this format:
    (Numerical Value)(Original Unit:C,F,K)(Converted Unit:C,F,K)
    Example: An input of 100CF instructs the program to convert 100 deg C into Fahrenheit.
