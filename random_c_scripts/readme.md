This folder serves as a collection of short programs written in C as I attempt to go over the book "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie. Most of these are modifications of example codes and exercises featured in the book fulfilling a particular curiosity of mine as I explore the concepts being discussed. 

A brief description of the programs part of this collection:

01basicwordcount.c - a modification of the sample program for character counting featured in the section 1.5.2 of the book.
