This is a small program simulating a menu selection based on one of the examples in the second chapter of the book Beginning CPP through Game programming, third edition by Michael Dawson.

The exercise is originally meant to demonstrate the concept of a switch in C++. I then modified it by implementing a simple error handling that warns the user if an incorrect input is made and allowing them to re-enter an input.
