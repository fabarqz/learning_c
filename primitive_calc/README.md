This is a basic calculator (hence the name primitive calc) written in C
can performm the following arithmetic operators between two numbers: addition subtraction,multiplication, division

the goal of this project is for me to recall what I know so far in c++ which isn't a lot since I've been hopping between languages. 
the goal right now is to stick between c, python, and javascript.

no handling for possible erroneous inputs is put in place yet. probably in the future as I revisit this to implement new learnings.
